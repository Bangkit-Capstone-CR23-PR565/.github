# Description
boothUP! is our collaborative project for our final project at Bangkit Academy 2023. This is an Event Recommendation app that connects SMEs and Event Organizers. In this app, SMEs could search for related events that they want to cooperate with.

## Project Background

Currently, there are still many SMEs that have difficulties in promoting their products at events due to the lack of information about suitable events and the costly participation fee, typically in Indonesia. Meanwhile, event organizers also have difficulties finding suitable SMEs to be included in the events held. This project will answer the research question by building an application that can connect SMEs with event organizers effectively and efficiently.
